<p>Shortly before the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States, and in the same week as the discovery that <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/rogue-scientists-race-save-climate-data-trump/">Trump’s EPA team intends to remove important climate data from the EPA’s website</a>, the Women’s Bureau of the US Department of Labor posted a link to download all of its electronic resources in a single zip file. This move has been interpreted as an attempt to save essential resources from being wiped out by the new Trump administration. While individuals are encouraged to access resources directly from <a href="https://www.dol.gov/wb/resources/">the Department of Labor’s site</a>, these files will also be hosted here in case they are ultimately removed from the government hosted site. This website collects no data or ad revenue, and exists solely as a public service.</p></br>

<h3>UPDATE:</h3>
   <p>In light of President Trump's continued silencing and suppression of various branches of the federal government, more documents may be added to this archive as needed.</p>

<p >In 2016 the National Park Service (NPS) celebrated the centennial of its 1916 Organic
Act and the 50th anniversary of the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), which established the framework for the current national preservation program. The National Park Service Cultural Resources Climate Change Strategy (CRCC Strategy) responds to the mandates of both Acts. The CRCC Strategy provides guidance for NPS managers to anticipate, plan for, and respond to the real and potential effects of a changing climate on the cultural resources the 1916 Act commits us to protect unimpaired for future generations. Under the NHPA, it further provides guidance to our many partners in the national historic preservation program to recognize and respond to a wide range of environmental changes that are threatening cultural resources in communities throughout the Nation.</p>
